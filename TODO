 - TASK
Repair test 'tests/TOREPAIR_04_009_verify_ko_signing_cert_corrupted'
note : this requires a modification of the code, if signing certificate is corrupted, then xmlsec throws ambiguous error logs during verification.
It would be better if before calling xmlsec function the certificate could be checked, and in case of error print a comprehensible message.
This is not critical : corrupted signing certificate is not a common case, and the command should throw an error anyway.


 - TASK
Repair test 'tests/TOREPAIR_04_015_verify_ko_custom_pem_cert_only_partial_chain'
note : this requires a modification of the code, if the certificate chain given to verify command is incomplete, then xmlsec throws ambiguous error logs.
It should not be hard to fix using a verification similar to the function pkirpmverify.c->populateCertChain() to make sure the certificate chain is complete, before calling xmlsec verification function, and in case of error print a comprehensible message.
This is an important fix : A user forgetting a certificate when verifying a signature is not uncommon, in this case they should have a comprehensible error message.
