### SHARED CONFIG ###
#####################

# The type of the test, for now only 2 values are accepted : SIGN or VERIFY
# This field is mandatory, meaning there is no default value for it
TEST_TYPE

# The path of the rpm file to sign or to verify. In the case of a sign test it is also the path of the output signed rpm.
INPUT_RPM_PATH

# The directory of the rpm file to sign or to verify.
INPUT_RPM_DIR

# The command arguments for the test. Arguments in this field are separated by space.
COMMAND_ARGS

# Each test can declare the files it requires. In a lot of cases these files are the same, which is why default files are
# available in tests/default_files_<sign|verify> directory. If this field is set to true then if there are missing files
# in the test directory, then these files are copied from the default files directory
# In some test you need a file to be missing to verify that the command reacts the right way, in these cases you may want to
# set this field to false
USE_DEFAULT_FILES_IF_NON_EXISTING


#############################
### SIGNATURE CONFIG ONLY ###
#############################

# The path of the expected rpm : the already existing rpm to compare the ouput of the signature with.
# In case of a valid signature test this should be a valid signed rpm, in case of a test where signature should not occur
# this should be the original, unsigned rpm for example.
# (default value should be ok in most situations for this one)
EXPECTED_RPM_OUTPUT_PATH

# The directory of the expected rpm (see EXPECTED_RPM_OUTPUT_PATH)
EXPECTED_RPM_OUTPUT_DIR

# The directory in which the keystore.p12 containing the signing key and cert should be set
P12_FILE_DIR

# This field should be set to 'false' to verify how the signing command behaves when the directory containing the keystore
# for the signature does not exist
DEFAULT_P12_DIRECTORY_EXISTS

# The password for the keystore containing the signing key and cert
P12_PASSWORD

# States whether the input rpm should be checked after the test. For example if the test consists in an unexisting input
# rpm this field shoud be set to false
VERIFY_RPM_CONTENT_AFTER_SIGNATURE

# States whether the default p12 file (/etc/pki/rpm-keys/keystore.p12) exists or not
DEFAULT_P12_FILE_EXISTS

# States whether the original rpm should be left intact after the test.
# This should be true for all tests where signature is KO
# (this field exists to prevent rpm duplications in the sources)
# WARNING : This field overrides EXPECTED_RPM_OUTPUT_PATH
RPM_LEFT_UNSIGNED


### VERIFICATION CONFIG ONLY ###

# This field is mandatory, meaning there is no default value for it (only in case the TEST_TYPE is 'VERIFY')
VERIFICATION_PEM_FILES_PATHS

# This field should be set to 'false' to verify how the verify command behaves when the directory containing the certificates
# use for verification does not exist
DEFAULT_VERIFICATION_CERTIFICATE_DIRECTORY_EXISTS

# States whether the default cert files (in directory /etc/pki/rpm-certs/) exist or not
DEFAULT_CERT_FILES_EXISTS

# The directory in which trusted certificates should be set
CERTS_DIR
