Error: wrong number of arguments.
	Usage: /var/tmp/current_test/pkirpmverify <file-to-verify> <pem-cert-chain-file> ...
	(There can be as many pem-cert-chain-file as needed, and they can contain from a single certificate only to the full certificate chain)
	Or : /var/tmp/current_test/pkirpmverify <file-to-verify>
This option finds the certificate chain in /etc/pki/rpm-certs/ provided that the cert chain (except the signing cert) is present in this directory
