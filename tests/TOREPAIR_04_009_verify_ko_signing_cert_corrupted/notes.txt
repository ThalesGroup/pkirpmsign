This test is broken because the code has to be fixed.
See the 'TODO' comment in populateCertChain function of pkirpmverify.c
Once done, the same test can be written in case the cert chain is provided in input arguments
(it might seem redundant but it really is a difference case)

For information :
    In this test, test.rpm file contains a xmldsig which contains the signing cert.
    This signing cert has been corrupted : the CN has been changed (from 'Aleksey Sanin' to 'Aleksey Sanon')
