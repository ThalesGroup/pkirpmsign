Test suite is not exhaustive.


To add more test, create a new directory under tests/.
The directory should be named <XX>_<YYY>_<DESCRIPTION>

Value for <XX> :
01 -> valid signature test case
02 -> invalid signature test case
03 -> valid verification test case
04 -> invalid verification test case

Value for <YY> the index of the test, take the biggest one for a given <XX> value and increment it.

DESCRIPTION includes the type of test (sign/verify and ok/ko), it is redundant with <XX> but it is more human readable.
It is snake case and should describe the test and be concise


Then the test has to be declared in tests/test_cases.txt, if it is not declared here it won't run.
If a test is declared but does not exist it will throw a warning.


The directory <XX>_<YYY>_<DESCRIPTION> must contain a testconfig.properties file.
This files contains the properties of the test, as described in tests/properties.txt
Most of the time default values are fine, but each test having its own specificities it helps being able to modify some values.
Of course there may also be cases for which a test has a specificity not supported by existing properties.
In this case the property can be created and implemented in the code (which is located in tests/current_test/test_in_container.sh)
but it is trickier.


Tests use both properties and files. There are default files both for signature and verification.
This prevents the duplication of large files.
For signature : tests/default_files_sign
For verification : tests/default_files_verify
In case these some of these files need to be overriden it is possible to simply add them under <XX>_<YYY>_<DESCRIPTION>
with the same name. Files under <XX>_<YYY>_<DESCRIPTION> are always used, while files in default directories are only used
if not already defined.
